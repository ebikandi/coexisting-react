# COEXISTING REACT VERSIONS

A project to test how different React versions can coexist in a same site. The project consists in a regular site which will fetch a React app and inject it to it's DOM. Both projects will have their own differen React version so this will help us test and manage how can affect injecting our apps directly to another site, and if one version overwrites the other. Also,we'll test the same with styles.
